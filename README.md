## 📍 NumPy Operations

- Arrays: Multi-dimensional arrays are created using numpy.array().
- Access/Modification: Array elements are accessed and modified using  slicing and indexing.
- Mathematical Operations: Operations like numpy.mean(), numpy.sum(), and - numpy.std() are used for calculations.
- Random Numbers: The numpy.random module is used to generate random numbers.
- Reshaping: numpy.reshape() and numpy.flatten() are used to change array dimensions.

## 📍 Pandas Operations

- DataFrame Creation: Data is structured into tables using pandas.DataFrame().
- Missing Data: Missing values are handled with dropna() and fillna() methods.
- GroupBy: Data is grouped using groupby() for statistical summaries.
- Merging: Data sets are merged using pd.concat() and pd.merge().
- Data Analysis: Unique values are analyzed with .unique() and .value_counts().
- Pivot Tables: Data summaries are created using pivot_table().

## 📍 Matplotlib Operations

- Basic Visualizations: Data was visualized with basic plots like scatter, histogram, and boxplot.
- Scatter Plots: Relationships between variables were shown using plt.scatter().
- Histograms: Data distributions were displayed using plt.hist().
- Boxplots: Data variability and outliers were analyzed using plt.boxplot().
- Subplots: Multiple plots were arranged in a single figure using plt.subplot().
- Figures: Advanced visualizations were customized with plt.figure() for better presentation.
- Advanced Customizations: Legends, labels, titles, and grid lines were added for clarity.

## 📍 Applications

- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Grouping and summarizing data
- Merging and transforming data
