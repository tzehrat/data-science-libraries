## 📍 NumPy Operations

Arrays: Multi-dimensional arrays are created using numpy.array().
Access/Modification: Array elements are accessed and modified using slicing and indexing.
Mathematical Operations: Operations like numpy.mean(), numpy.sum(), and numpy.std() are used for calculations.
Random Numbers: The numpy.random module is used to generate random numbers.
Reshaping: numpy.reshape() and numpy.flatten() are used to change array dimensions.

## 📍 Pandas Operations

DataFrame Creation: Data is structured into tables using pandas.DataFrame().
Missing Data: Missing values are handled with dropna() and fillna() methods.
GroupBy: Data is grouped using groupby() for statistical summaries.
Merging: Data sets are merged using pd.concat() and pd.merge().
Data Analysis: Unique values are analyzed with .unique() and .value_counts().
Pivot Tables: Data summaries are created using pivot_table().
